Builder Pattern - Humania.cpp  

The first design pattern that we have implemented is the builder pattern. The file Humania.cpp controls all the functions of the game. It
is where all the objects are created and and functions according to them are implemented.

The assets and the objects that are moving downwards are implemented on this pattern. All the assests are being generated and then destroyed

Now this pattern is of the game.cpp class this means that the whole project code and the controls along with the arow keys are being
controlled by this game.cpp class. The file also makes use of the sound that are added into the game along with the mixer
